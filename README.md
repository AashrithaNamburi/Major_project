PROJECT TASK: Take any Dataset of your choice ,perform EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and apply a suitable Classifier,Regressor or Clusterer and calculate the accuracy of the model.

I have taken the grades dataset from Kaggle.

Completed exploratory data analysis after normalising the data.

Since the dataset was too small, I enlarged the dataset to improve the accuracy.

I reshaped the x and y values since they were 1d arrays otherwise.

I used random forest classfier, random forest regressor and SVM models.

The accuracies I got in each case were 80.0, 76.92917188805347 and 80.0
